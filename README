QUICK START GUIDE

Here's a quick overview of how to get started with using the system:-

If you've create a sql script that gives you the results you want, typing this at a command line:-
    genGDRTests -c namedODBCConnectionToYourInstanceAndDatabase -i YourTestScript.sql -o TheNameOfTheUnitTestYouWantToCreate.cs
or if you have a taste for the perverse,
    genGDRTests -c namedODBCConnectionToYourInstanceAndDatabase -i YourTestScript.sql -o TheNameOfTheUnitTestYouWantToCreate.vb

will create a .NET Unit Test source file and resource file in the current directory, ready to be added to your unit test project.

Once this has been done, you can check the generated unit test (without compiling it or adding it to a test project) :-
    runGDRTest -c namedODBCConnectionToYourInstanceAndDatabase -i TheNameOfTheUnitTestYouWantToCreate.cs
                
Once you've accumulated a few unit tests, you may want to sweep them all up into a single file that contains multiple tests :-                
   mergeGDRTests -o CombinedUnitTestFileName.cs -i UnitTestOne.cs -i UnitTestTwo.vb -i UnitTestThree.cs ( and so on )
